CXL on Linux: Boot To Bash
==========================

This documentation is intended as a companion to systems engineers (Platform, BIOS, EFI, OS, etc) trying to enable CXL devices on Linux.

My only real goal is to help make the CXL ecosystem an ever-so-slightly more sane environment, for my own sake.

I hope this helps you as well.
